# Android-Weather-Tracker
This app will tell you the temperature, humidity value, weather, etc for a given city, then import it to a SQLite database.

The first step into the process for this application is to enter any given city within the US. This utilizes a JSON web server to pull this data. 
For example: 
  Enter "Boston, MA" and it will give you the following: Temperature in fahrenheit, weather (cloudy, rainy, sunny etc.) humidity value. 
  
You then are able to swipe to the right to enter what you saw in to a database, which utilizes SQLite. Hit the enter button to store all of the informaton into the database.
You then may look at the data later, and it sorts by date of entry.
